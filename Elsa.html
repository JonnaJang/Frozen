    <p><strong><u>Elsa</u></strong> of Arendelle is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Animation Studios' 53rd animated film Frozen and its sequel Frozen II.<br>
    She is voiced primarily by Broadway actress and singer Idina Menzel.<br>
    She is voiced by Eva Bella as a young child and by Spencer Ganus as a teenager in Frozen.<br>
    In Frozen II, young Elsa is voiced by Mattea Conforti (at the start of the film) and Eva Bella (archive audio).<br></p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Created by directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee,<br>
    Elsa is loosely based on the title character of "The Snow Queen", a Danish fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen.<br>
    In the Disney film adaptation, she is introduced as a princess in the fictional Scandinavian Kingdom of Arendelle, heiress to the throne and the elder sister of Princess Anna (Kristen Bell).<br>
    Elsa has the magical ability to create and manipulate ice and snow.<br>
    She inadvertently sends Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of her coronation.<br>
    Throughout the film, she struggles first with controlling and concealing her abilities and then with liberating herself from her fears of unintentionally harming others, especially her younger sister.<br></p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">The Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the original fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction.<br>
    Several film executives, including Walt Disney, attempted to build on the character, and a number of scheduled film adaptions were shelved when they could not work out the character.<br>
    Buck and his co-director, Jennifer Lee, were ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters.<br>
    As much as Anna's struggle is external, Elsa's is internal.<br>
    This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.<br></p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Elsa has received largely positive reception from reviewers, who praised her complex characterization and vulnerability.<br>
    Menzel was also widely praised for her vocal performance of Elsa, especially that of her performance of the song "Let It Go".<br></p>
