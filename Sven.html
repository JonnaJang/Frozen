    <p>Sven is a fictional character who most prominently appears in the animated film Frozen (2013) and its sequel, Frozen II (2019), produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios.<br>
      He is a reindeer that lives together with his companion, Kristoff. Sven, alongside Kristoff, assists princess Anna in her search for her sister, queen Elsa, who has run away after placing the kingdom of Arendelle under an eternal winter.<br>
      During their adventure, Sven also meets and befriends a living snowman, Olaf.<br>
      Years after the events from the first film, Sven and the others go in search of a mysterious voice heard by Elsa.<br>
      In the course of the journey, Sven meets other reindeer. Besides the two films, Sven is also present in the short film Frozen Fever (2015) and the featurette Olaf's Frozen Adventure (2017).<br></p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Sven was created by Frozen  directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee.<br>
      In the making of Sven's character, the animation team brought a real-life reindeer into the studio in order to study its behavior and incorporate the observed elements in Sven's portrayal.<br>
      Nonetheless, because of the reindeer's lack of motion, Sven's depiction was eventually developed based on the mannerisms of a dog.<br>
      His appearance was designed to be realistic.<br></p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Critical reception of Sven's character has been generally positive, with journalists commending his loyalty and describing him as lovable.<br>
      Reviewers have also regarded Sven as a source of comic relief, and they have praised his relationship with Kristoff.<br>
      Merchandise inspired by the character has been released, including stuffed toys and action figures.<br></p>
