      <p><strong>Olaf</strong> is a fictional character from Disney's Frozen franchise, produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios.<br>
      Olaf is first presented in Frozen (2013) as an animate snowman created by Elsa and Anna in their childhood.<br>
      He then reappears as an anthropomorphic character in the film as Anna searches for her runaway sister in hopes of restoring summer.<br>
      Olaf has reappeared when Elsa accidentally turns Arendelle into a wintery abyss.<br>
      Olaf helps Anna and Kristoff find Elsa and journeys with them all the way back to the kingdom, where he remains part of the sisters' lives and appears again in the 2019 film, Frozen II.<br></p>
